## 📊 Gap Analysis

### ✅ What's Done (25%)
- [x] Database schema (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- [x] Authentication (PIN-based)
- [x] Basic UI shell (monochrome design)
- [x] Docker environment
- [x] Protected routes

### ❌ What's Missing (75%)

#### Critical Gaps (MUST FIX)
1. **Cart doesn't work** - Can't add/remove items
2. **Orders can't be placed** - No checkout flow
3. **Payment doesn't exist** - No way to complete sales
4. **Tables are static** - No status tracking
5. **Kitchen display is fake** - Just mockup
6. **Reports show nothing** - Static demo data

## 💻 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Cart State Management (Zustand)
```typescript
interface CartStore {
  items: CartItem[]
  addItem: (item: MenuItem) => void
  updateQuantity: (id: string, quantity: number) => void
  removeItem: (id: string) => void
  clearCart: () => void
  getSubtotal: () => number
  getTax: () => number
  getTotal: () => number
}
```

### 2. Order Flow
```typescript
Order Creation Pipeline:
1. Select order type
2. Add items to cart
3. Enter customer info (optional)
4. Select payment method
5. Process payment
6. Generate order number
7. Save to database
8. Send to kitchen
9. Print receipt
10. Clear cart
```

### 3. Real-time Events
```typescript
Socket Events:
- 'order:created' → New order notification
- 'order:updated' → Status change
- 'table:occupied' → Table status update
- 'kitchen:ready' → Order ready notification
- 'payment:completed' → Payment confirmed
```

### 4. Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created ON orders(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order ON order_items(order_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_phone ON customers(phone);
```
